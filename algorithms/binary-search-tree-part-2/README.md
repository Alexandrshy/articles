# Data structures. Binary Search Tree in JavaScript (Part-2: practicing)

In the previous post [Binary Search Tree in JavaScript](https://dev.to/alexandrshy/data-structures-binary-search-tree-in-javascript-3om9) we wrote our own implementation in JavaScript with a basic interface. Now we'll try to expand it.

## Traversal

Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Stacks, etc.), which have only one logical way of traversing them, trees can be traversed in different ways. Ways for traversing the binary search tree:

- Inorder traversal
- Postorder traversal
- Preorder traversal

Let's focus on each in more detail.

### Inorder traversal

Tree traversal algorithm:

1. Traverse the left subtree
1. Visit the root of the tree
1. Traverse the right subtree

For example

For all examples, we'll use the binary tree from the previous part

![Binary Search Tree](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ybacgegn1ccjxh5d3xh7.jpg)

For this binary search tree, this method should return such an array `[6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 24, 29, 37, 42, 55]`.

```js
inOrder() {
  if (this.root === null) return null;
  const nodeList = [];
  const traverse = function(current) {
    if (current.left) traverse(current.left);
    nodeList.push(current.data);
    if (current.right) traverse(current.right);
  };
  traverse(this.root);
  return nodeList;
};
```

#### Algorithm

1. If root property is empty then return `null`
1. Create the variable `nodeList` to store the node value
1. Create the method `traverse`, this method takes a node as an argument
1. The `traverse` method is recursively called for all elements of the tree according to the algorithm that we announced earlier
1. And as a result, we return the `nodeList` variable

Check the result

```js
console.log(tree.inOrder()); // [6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 24, 29, 37, 42, 55]
```

### Postorder traversal

Tree traversal algorithm:

1. Traverse the left subtree
1. Traverse the right subtree
1. Visit the root of the tree

For the previously used binary search tree, this method should return such an array `[6, 12, 11, 8, 16, 29, 24, 55, 42, 37, 13]`.

```js
postOrder() {
  if (this.root === null) return null;
  const nodeList = [];
  const traverse = function(current) {
    if (current.left) traverse(current.left);
    if (current.right) traverse(current.right);
    nodeList.push(current.data);
  };
  traverse(this.root);
  return nodeList;
};
```

#### Algorithm

1. If root property is empty then return `null`
1. Create the variable `nodeList` to store the node value
1. Create the method `traverse`, this method takes a node as an argument
1. The `traverse` method is recursively called for all elements of the tree according to the algorithm that we announced earlier
1. And as a result, we return the `nodeList` variable

Check the result

```js
console.log(tree.postOrder()); // [6, 12, 11, 8, 16, 29, 24, 55, 42, 37, 13]
```

### Preorder traversal

Tree traversal algorithm:

1. Visit the root of the tree
1. Traverse the left subtree
1. Traverse the right subtree

For the previously used binary search tree, this method should return such an array `[13, 8, 6, 11, 12, 37, 24, 16, 29, 42, 55]`.

```js
preOrder() {
  if (this.root === null) return null;
  const nodeList = [];
  const traverse = function(current) {
    nodeList.push(current.data);
    if (current.left) traverse(current.left);
    if (current.right) traverse(current.right);
  };
  traverse(this.root);
  return nodeList;
}
```

#### Algorithm

1. If root property is empty then return `null`
1. Create the variable `nodeList` to store the node value
1. Create the method `traverse`, this method takes a node as an argument
1. The `traverse` method is recursively called for all elements of the tree according to the algorithm that we announced earlier
1. And as a result, we return the `nodeList` variable

Check the result

```js
console.log(tree.preOrder()); // [13, 8, 6, 11, 12, 37, 24, 16, 29, 42, 55]
```

We have considered three ways to traversal a binary tree. The main idea of these three methods is visiting each node exactly once. As you can see, the implementation of these methods is very similar to each other and we visit each node only once.

## Finding maximum and minimum node values

Finding the maximum or minimum node in the binary search tree is a very common task.

Let's look at our tree again

![Binary Search Tree with maximum and minimum](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xb9u1gacmyytrjszjjgk.jpg)

For this binary search tree, the minimum value is 6 and the maximum value is 55. I think you already see the pattern ðŸ™‚

### Find maximum

Since in the binary search tree the value is already sorted to get the maximum value we need to get the value of the right child node.

```js
findMax() {
  let current = this.root;
  if (!current) return null;
  while (current.right) {
    current = current.right;
  }
  return current.data;
};
```

#### Algorithm

1. If root property is empty then return `null`
1. Create the variable `current` here we'll store the current node
1. While the current node has the right child we need to update the value to `current`
1. Return the `current` value

Check the result for the tree that was considered earlier.

```js
console.log(tree.findMax()); // 55
```

### Find minimum

Now let's do the same for the left child node and we'll get the minimum value. It's really that simple ðŸ™‚

```js
findMin() {
  let current = this.root;
  if (!current) return null;
  while (current.left) {
    current = current.left;
  }
  return current.data;
};
```

#### Algorithm

1. If root property is empty then return `null`
1. Create the variable `current` here we'll store the current node
1. While the current node has the left child we need to update the value to `current`
1. Return the `current` value

Check the result for the tree that was considered earlier.

```js
tree.findMin(); // 6
```
