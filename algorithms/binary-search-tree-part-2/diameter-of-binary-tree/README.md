## Diameter of Binary Tree

### Problem

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

### Example 1

Given a binary tree

```
       4
      / \
     2   5
    / \
   1   3
```

Return 3, which is the length of the path `[1, 2, 4, 5]` or `[3, 2, 4, 5]`.

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
