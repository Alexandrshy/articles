## Same Tree

### Problem

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they're the same or not.

Two binary trees considered the same if they're structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

### Example 1

```
Input:     2         2
          / \       / \
         1   3     1   3

        [2,1,3],   [2,1,3]

Output: true
```

### Example 2

```
Input:     2       2
          /         \
         1           1

        [1,2],   [1,null,2]

Output: false
```

### Example 3

```
Input:     3         3
          / \       / \
         2   1     1   2

        [3,2,1],   [3,1,2]

Output: false
```
